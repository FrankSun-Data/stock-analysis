Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this project is to analyze the trading volumes and annual returns for the energy stocks in the year of 2017 and 2018.

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
Based on the analysis, only two stocks achieved positive return on 2018 comparing with 11 stocks in 2017. We can clear see that the trading volume in 2017 was much higher 
than 2018.The execution time was shortened by the refactoring.


Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantage is very obvious, we can improve the efficiency by doing the refactoring. The disadvantage is we need to make changes to the existing correct code,
which may be a little bit risky if we are not very comfortable with refactoring code.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
